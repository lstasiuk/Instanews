This is Project 2 in Web Development at Red Academy.  We were insructed to replicate a site that pulls stories from the NY Times by sections of interest.

This is our first project using Javascript and jQuery and was very challenging.

Major learnings for this project included:
- Honing our HTML skills
- Javascript
- jQuery
- Using api and ajax to retrieve information from another website
- Partials and organizing our project efficiently
- Sass
- Media queries for tablet and desktop sizes
- Animation
